Having worked with quite a few payment processors, I'm convinced that
cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will be the future of online transactions. Here
are some selected reasons why I believe in Bitcoin:

It's Open Source
----------------

Instead of blindly trusting your payment provider to keep your money safe, you
can take care of it yourself. You don't have to trust anyone (well, maybe
except your compiler). As a developer, you have the complete source code for
reference. No more reverse-engineering.

It's Decentralized
------------------

Using Bitcoin means I, as a developer, control everything related to the API
I'll be working with. No more SOAP APIs with out-dated PDF documentations. No
more applying for a test account which requires tons of paperwork - I can just
use the testnet to test my app as thoroughly as required.

It's Future Proof
-----------------

There's exciting stuff on the horizon like `BIP 70`_ which enables even
smoother online transactions. What's more, transaction scripting allows all
kinds of stuff which would hitherto be delegated to the legal dept like
`Contracts`_

.. _Contracts: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts

Conclusion
----------

Overall it's a fun time to be experimenting with cryptocurrencies! The
potential for Bitcoin is so huge that the expected value would remain high even
with a low chance of success. That's why I'm betting on Bitcoin.
