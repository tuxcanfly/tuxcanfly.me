Now let me start by saying that I have toyed with the idea of Stoicism for a
while and still consider myself one. But I also believe that, like a good
lawyer, one should be able to defend both sides of a case. So consider me a
Devil's advocate for this post.

Stoicism is like the grumpy old grandpa who stops you from enjoying too much.
He chides you for being a cry-baby even when you're badly hurt and makes fun of
you when you're feeling really sad.

The idea of a Sage neither enjoying pleasure nor suffering pain seems alluring
at first but one is compelled to ask: Is such a person even alive? One could
say that he has indeed committed mental suicide. Worse still, by suppressing
the natural instinct and holding himself to an impractical and unattainable
ideal, he is preparing the ground for an even bigger disappointment.

The Stoics were right in believing that nature sets the course of our lives.
But it should not be ignored that people also have some control over their
lives. When you accept stoicism, you might feel tempted to attribute more
control to nature because it helps you avoid responsibility.  Stoicism is the
lazy person's dream come true. It allows him to give up, resign to his fate and
feel virtuous about it.

We should also remember that all advances in Science and Technology have been
possible because people did not give up control to nature but instead fought
tooth and nail for every inch of it. I'm glad that Edward Jenner didn't remain
stoic when people were dying of Smallpox. As the boundaries of human knowledge
increase, we gain more control over nature. At the very least, the Stoic should
factor this into his belief.

Lastly, Stoicism saps the human spirit out of life and replaces it with a
pointless virtue. Is a virtue which denies us the human experience worth it?
