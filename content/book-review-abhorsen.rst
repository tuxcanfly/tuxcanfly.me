    It's always better to be doing [than to live with the fear]

    -- Garth Nix

This is a combined review for both Lirael and Abhorsen since they are the
continuation of Sabriel in the Old Kingdom trilogy.

Lirael:

Lirael starts off with the sob story of a young girl supposedly the daughter of
the Clayr (plural - some sort of Oracle). She is impatient about the Sight - a
gift of the Clayr which is denied to her even though she has grown up. As an
awkward, shy and depressed character, Lirael evokes some sympathy, but the
self-loathing gets a bit tiring after a while. She eventually gets a job in a
library and is drawn into an adventure where she finds a dog statue which she
brings to life using magic. The dog - called the Disreputable Dog is similar to
the cat Mogget in some aspects. Meanwhile, we meet Sameth, son of Sabriel who
is supposedly the Abhorsen in waiting, filling in his mother's shoes in
Ancelstierre. The rest of the book explains how Lirael and Sameth find
themselves drawn to an epic battle against Hedge - the rogue necromancer.

Abhorsen:

Abhorsen is the final book in the trilogy and it explains some of the mysteries
about the magical world of Old Kingdom. Lirael, Sameth, Mogget and the
Disreputable Dog start off toward the Red Lake to stop the magical evil
hemi-spheres from combining and re-incarnating the Destroyer. Will they be able
to stop the Destroyer from coming back to life and destroying everything?
Let's just say that answer might not be surprising...

Questions about Mogget and the Disreputable Dog's origins are explained,
although somewhat shallowly. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was waiting
for an "AHA!" moment which will enlighten me about the hidden meaning and some
philosophy of Death (or the lack thereof), but I had to remain contended with
the action.

Overall I think the trilogy was aimed at a younger audience than me, so I guess
I couldn't enjoy it as much. If I had read it 5-6 years ago, I would have
probably liked it better.

A good read for time-pass but so-so otherwise - 3.5/5.
