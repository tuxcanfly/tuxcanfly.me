.. epigraph::

    To think ‘it is,’ is eternalism,
    To think ‘it is not,’ is nihilism:
    Being and non-being,
    The wise cling not to either.

    -- Nagarjuna

    قید حیات و بند غم ، اصل میں دونوں ایک ہیں
    موت سے پہلے آدمی غم سے نجات پائے کیوں؟

    The prison of life and the bondage of grief are one and the same
    Before the onset of death, how can man expect to be free of grief?

    -- Ghalib

    Humans have complicated every simple gift of the gods
    
    -- Diogenes of Sinope

UG Krishnamurti, in my opinion, is the most under-rated philosopher in modern
times. He is right in calling out the people who sell 'enlightenment' as a
means of eternal happiness - the saints, sages and saviors of mankind. If it
means anything at all, enlightenment ought to be the realization of the trap
that is life and how there's nothing we can do but enjoy as well as endure it
in all it's glory. There's nothing an enlightened soul can possibly do other
than continue being what it was, because it realizes that every thought is but
another dig into the bottomless pit that is life.

Once the realization of being and non-being becomes apparent, a unique kind of
irony begins it's mockery. If what is, simply is and what isn't simply isn't,
then what is the realization? What knowledge, lesson or wisdom is to be gained
by thinking?  How can you possibly explain this wisdom, if it exists, to
another person, using words? How can you communicate the state of being -
thinking and non-being - the void - using just words? This is why Zen is often
taught using Koans, it's not so much as a moral lesson to be gained by reading the
Koan as it's a wordplay designed to trick the mind into non-being.

The only positive aspect of enlightenment then is to make use of the knowledge
that everything that exists, does so justly and naturally, that nothing which
cannot exist will ever exist, therefore, there is truly nothing to worry about
- except the worries created by our own thoughts. And thus, a Stoic is born.
