Review:
=======

Fooled By Randomness is the second book in the `Incerto` series by Nassim
Nicholas Taleb. Like The Black Swan, it is a treatise on the philosophy of
uncertainty, a field dominated by Taleb.  Whereas The Black Swan talks about
epistemological missing links or the gaps in our knowledge, Fooled By
Randomness is more focussed on the effects of these highly unlikely, yet potent
risks, lurking in the shadows of uncertainty.

What would happen if the Markets collapse tomorrow? Or your currency gets
devalued due to Hyperinflation? What if you are on the way to an important
meeting and your car has a flat tire? What if something truly out of the
ordinary happens in our lifetime? (Aliens?) As a proponent of Stoicism, Taleb
asks us to imagine every scenario under the sun which maybe highly unlikely,
but is still possible. As a software person, I find this is rather similar to
a systems architect or an engineer following Murphy's Law and assuming the
worst scenarios are virtually a certainty. However, the truly novel idea put
forward in this book is to assign a value to each of these uncertainties, so we
can sum up all the scenarios and arrive at an Expected Value (sum of all
probabilities multiplied by their values) and act accordingly.

I think many people are familiar with Gambler's Fallacy, where people expect
that a string of losses must be offset by a string of subsequent wins. If we
assume life to be random sequence (as Taleb suggests) it only makes sense that
we should avoid such a fallacy in our daily lives (i.e just because you are
unlucky today doesn't mean you will be lucky tomorrow; don't wait for a
miracle). Gambler or not, we need to account for the uncertainties and be
prepared for everything life throws at us.

5/5 - Must Read
