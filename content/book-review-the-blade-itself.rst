    Shit

    -- Almost everyone in this book

    Once you've got a task to do, it's better to do it than live with the fear of it.

    -- Logen Ninefingers

The Blade Itself is the first book in the First Law series and it prepares the
ground for an epic battle.

Reading the book is like immersing yourself in it's universe and watching the
characters in God Mode. Hands down, it has the best narrative I've ever read.
The characters feel so real, you just almost touch them. Every scene in the
book is vividly imprinted in the reader's memory in exquisite detail. This is
one of the few books that I enjoyed reading all the way, enjoyed more than
anticipation for the end.

Overall the story itself is simple, it's laying down the groundwork for a
battle - an epic battle between the Union, Bethod, the Gurkish and various
other factions; but the narrative builds up so slowly and vividly that it
catches you by surprise when all the blocks fall into place.

Glokta, a cripple, was a Prisoner-of-War who was tortured and returned to the
union.  Now he's the Inquisitor who tortures other people, pointlessly (or
fun, who knows?) One of his adventures with one Salem Rews, gets out of control
as everyone from the Supervisor Kaline to the Arch Lector Sult wants to use
Rews to sign off a confession for them. Glokta later realizes that he himself
was being played upon by the Arch Lector.

Jezal dan Luthar is a young man, one would probably call him the hero of this
book, who is training to fight a fencing match championship. He falls in love
with his friend Major West's sister Ardi and some amusing events follow.

Logen Ninefingers is a savage, brutal, primitive northman who has escaped the
Shanka (like Orcs) and on his way to find the first of the twelve Magi, Bayaz.
After meeting Bayaz, they reach the union where their paths cross Glokta's and
Luthar's.

Ferro Maljinn, a fierce, ex-slave girl and the Magus Yulwei cross the Gurkish
badlands to come over to the union as a part of a bigger plan between the magi.

On a very high level, the book is reminiscent of the Fellowship of the Ring i.e.
a rendezvous of the good guys preparing for a battle.

On a philosophical level, I can't help but notice the parallels between the
myths of Juvens and Biblical stories. Even without reading too much into it,
Juvens and Kanedius' rivarly reminds us of Caine and Abel. Juvens himself
feels similar to Jesus, with twelve followers, one of whom is the betrayer
(Khalul). Juvens' Laws are similar to the Ten Commandments. The argument
between Bayaz and Yulwei regarding the First Law is the classic debate of
Consequentialism vs Deontology.
