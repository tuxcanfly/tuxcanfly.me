.. epigraph::

    I am not a happy man, Ender. Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely
    asks us to be brilliant on its behalf. Survival first, then happiness as we can
    manage it.

    -- Mazer Rackham

    Welcome to the human race. Nobody controls his own life, Ender. The best you
    can do is choose to fill the roles given you by good people, by people who love
    you.

    -- Valentine


Ender's Game is set in a futuristic, sci-fi, alien-invasion dystopian world and
yet it feels so close to home, probably because it deals with a lot of everyday
themes like bullying, leadership, group dynamics, emotional manipulation,
Nietzschean determination, free will and the quest for purpose in life.

Ender is the "third" child of religiously-confused parents in a world where
population control has created a stigma for younger siblings. Ender is
ridiculed and bullied for it by both his classmates as well his older brother,
Peter, who is kind of like Stewie from Family Guy, but not in a funny way.
Ender's sister, Valentine, is one of the few people who love him and both his
siblings play a major part later in the story.

Soon after Ender overcomes his fear to counter-attack a bully, he's approached
by one Colonel Graff to recruit him for a super important mission to save the
world from aliens (called buggers)! He's introduced to a gaming arena where he
must fight as a team against the enemy team using laser-tag like guns in
zero-G. Later he realizes that he's being played around by the higher ups to
break him down and test his mettle. But Ender, being the protagonist, doesn't
give up and keeps beating every challenge set forth by them grown-ups.

After graduating from Battle School and waging another counter-attack on a
bully, Ender finally gives up and doesn't want to fight the games anymore.
Meanwhile, Peter and Valentine back on Earth have become the world's first
social engineers who use their genius to influence policy and opinions about
dealing with the aliens. The grown-ups convince Valentine to talk him into
continuing his training with Command School. After much persuasion, Ender
overcomes his crisis and returns to the arena. Is Ender the man who is going to
save the world from the third alien invasion? Why did the Aliens attack Earth
in the first place and what do they want? What will Peter do with his new found
power over people's opinions?

I really love how different themes tie together in the big picture - buggers
are just bullies on the inter-galactic level; buggers' hivemind is similar to
emotional manipulation that's being done to Ender; Ender, Valentine and Peter
and their actions are reminiscent of the Hindu trinity - Brahma, Vishnu and
Shiva.

5/5 - Inspiring and thought-provoking read.
