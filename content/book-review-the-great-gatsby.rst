.. epigraph::

    Reserving judgements is a matter of infinite hope.

    Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and not after he is dead

    -- F. Scott Fitzgerald

The Great Gatsby is a showcase of the upper-class American society of the early
20th century. It's a cautionary tale of how unbridled desire can be
devastating. If you've seen the movie American Beauty (or The Great Gatsby),
you will probably find this book very similar.

Jay Gatsby is an intriguing character with a dark past and extravagant
lifestyle. Nick, a young hard-working salesman is the narrator and Gatsby's
neighbor. Tom and Daisy are couple who are Nick's friends and live nearby.
Jordan Baker, a young woman, is Daisy's friend and Nick's girlfriend. The last
couple - George and Myrtle are living in an unhappy marriage. To make matters
worse, Tom is cheating on his wife with Myrtle and Gatsby is trying to get back
Daisy, who rejected him when we wasn't rich. The action starts to unroll when
one unfortunate day their paths cross.

The tale takes a jab at the concept of "American Dream" (or any one predefined
way of living, really). Gatsby is rumored to be a murderer as soon as people
realize how rich he is; Gatsby's "Oxford" qualification is called into question
when Tom confronts him - all subtle hints at the psyche of the characters.

4/5 - Short and sweet tale about relationships, lust, and materialism.
