.. epigraph::

    Truly, life is the misery we endure between disappointments

    -- Glokta

Last argument of kings is the third and last book in the First Law series and
it ends with an epic showdown of the war between the Union and Gurkish and
Bethod.

Glokta returns from Dagoska and is surprised to be promoted to the role of
Superior. Now, his task is to uncover the mysterious death of the crown prince
and rig the elections to make sure Arch Lector Sult isn't embarrassed by the
soon to be elected King. As he investigates, he finds himself in a tough spot
as his beneficiary, the mysterious bank of Valint and Balk wants him to spy on
his master, the Arch Lector himself. Will Glokta's wish to die and get rid of
his miserable life be fulfilled at last?

Bayaz returns empty-handed from the End of the World, and spins up a plan to
make Jezal the new King. Jezal's journey from a low ranking, vain and spoilt
officer to the King is remarkable. But his happiness is soon ruined due to
Bayaz and his unhappy wife. Meanwhile, the Gurkish are closing in on the city
with huge armies. What will happen of the Union when Gurkish run over it?

Ferro finds the seed in the house of the Maker, and Bayaz use this to his
advantage against Mamun and his hundred words. The incidents in the house of
the Maker invovling Tolomei and Yulwei makes one suspicious about the honesty
and intentions of Bayaz. Are Khalul the prophet and Mamun indeed the righteous
ones?

Philosophically, the book seems to provoke moral nihilism - there is no good
and evil - only power.

4/5 - a fitting epic end to the series.
